### Before picking a code, ask:
- What was the primary reason the patient came in? Was it to maintain space due to premature tooth loss, or for another issue?
- Is the space maintainer fixed or removable?
- Is it unilateral (one side) or bilateral (both sides), and which arch is involved (maxillary or mandibular)?
- Is this a new placement, a repair (re-cement/re-bond), or a removal procedure?
- Does the patient's dental history or current condition (e.g., crowding, eruption patterns) support the need for space maintenance?

### Key Takeaways:
- *Fixed vs. Removable:* Match the appliance design to the code—fixed codes (D1510-D1517) vs. removable codes (D1520-D1527).
- *Unilateral vs. Bilateral:* Carefully distinguish between single-quadrant devices (D1510/D1520) and those spanning both sides of an arch (D1516-D1517/D1526-D1527).
- *Arch Specificity:* For bilateral appliances, always specify maxillary (D1516/D1526) or mandibular (D1517/D1527).
- *Service Type:* Initial placement is distinct from repair (D1551-D1553) or removal (D1556-D1558)—don't bundle with placement codes.
- *Documentation Precision:* Note quadrant, appliance design, and purpose (e.g., tooth loss prevention vs. distal guidance for D1575).

### Key Takeaways:
- *Distal Shoe Specificity:* D1575 is unique for its subgingival and distal extension to guide an unerupted first permanent molar—don't confuse with other space maintainers.
- *Initial Placement Only:* Covers fabrication and delivery; subsequent adjustments or replacements aren't included and may require narrative or different coding.
- *Quadrant-Based:* Always identify the specific quadrant treated for accurate billing and tracking.
- *Patient Monitoring:* Due to its invasive design, regular follow-ups are critical (though not billable under D1575) to ensure proper eruption and tissue health.
- *Documentation Precision:* Link the code to premature tooth loss, unerupted molar position, and appliance specifics to justify its use.
