You are a highly experienced dental coding expert specializing in temporomandibular joint disorders,

## **TMJ Dysfunction Treatment Procedures**

### **Before picking a code, ask:**
- What specific type of TMJ procedure is being performed (reduction of dislocation, surgery, arthroscopy, etc.)?
- Is an open or closed surgical approach being used for the procedure?
- If treating dislocation, is it acute or chronic/recurrent?
- Is the procedure diagnostic (arthroscopy with biopsy) or therapeutic?
- What specific anatomical components of the TMJ are being addressed (disc, condyle, articular surfaces)?
- Is anesthesia required for manipulation of the joint?
- Does the procedure involve implantation of materials or devices?
- Is the procedure addressing bony structures, soft tissues, or both?
- What is the extent of the procedure (minimally invasive vs. extensive reconstruction)?
- Has the patient undergone previous TMJ procedures that might influence code selection?

#### **Code: D7810** – *Open reduction of dislocation*
**Use when:** Performing a surgical procedure requiring incision and direct exposure of the temporomandibular joint to reduce a dislocated condyle and reposition it within the glenoid fossa.
**Check:** Documentation should detail the surgical approach, exposure of the joint space, the specific technique used to reduce the dislocation, and stabilization methods employed.
**Note:** Open reduction is typically reserved for cases where closed reduction has failed or is contraindicated, such as in long-standing dislocations with fibrosis, bony or fibrous ankylosis, or mechanical obstructions preventing closed reduction. The operative report should document the etiology and duration of the dislocation, previous reduction attempts if applicable, the specific surgical approach (preauricular, endaural, retromandibular), protection of vital structures (facial nerve), method of joint exposure, findings upon direct visualization, technique for condylar repositioning, stabilization methods, and evaluation of mandibular function following reduction. This procedure often requires post-operative limitation of mandibular movement which should be addressed in the documentation.

#### **Code: D7820** – *Closed reduction of dislocation*
**Use when:** Manually reducing a dislocated temporomandibular joint without surgical incision, typically through manipulation and pressure techniques that reposition the condyle back into the glenoid fossa.
**Check:** Documentation should specify the technique used for closed manipulation, confirm successful reduction, and detail any sedation or anesthesia utilized during the procedure.
**Note:** Closed reduction is the primary approach for acute TMJ dislocations. The procedure note should document the history and suspected cause of dislocation, duration of the dislocation, clinical findings (inability to close, anterior open bite, preauricular depression), the specific manipulation technique employed (downward and backward pressure on molars with thumbs while supporting the chin), confirmation of successful reduction (restoration of normal occlusion, joint function, and range of motion), any medications or relaxation techniques used to facilitate reduction, and post-reduction instructions regarding limited opening and avoidance of precipitating factors. For recurrent dislocations, documentation should also address counseling regarding long-term management strategies.

#### **Code: D7830** – *Manipulation under anesthesia*
**Use when:** Performing manipulation of the temporomandibular joint to improve mobility, reduce adhesions, or correct positioning while the patient is under general anesthesia or deep sedation.
**Check:** Documentation should confirm administration of anesthesia or deep sedation, detail the specific manipulation techniques employed, and record pre- and post-procedure range of motion.
**Note:** This procedure is typically performed for patients with restricted jaw movement due to muscle splinting, mild adhesions, or disc displacement that cannot be adequately addressed in the conscious patient. The comprehensive documentation should include the pre-procedure evaluation of mandibular mobility (maximum opening, lateral and protrusive movements), justification for manipulation under anesthesia, anesthesia protocol, specific manipulation techniques employed (including direction, force application, and sequence), audible or palpable findings during manipulation, immediate post-procedure range of motion assessment, and the physical therapy or follow-up protocol. This procedure is often performed in conjunction with arthrocentesis or arthroscopy, which should be separately documented if performed.

#### **Code: D7840** – *Condylectomy*
**Use when:** Surgically removing all or a portion of the mandibular condyle, typically to address pathology, deformity, or as part of a TMJ reconstruction procedure.
**Check:** Documentation should specify whether the condylectomy is complete or partial (high, proportional, or low), detail the surgical approach, and explain the clinical justification for condylar removal.
**Note:** Condylectomy is a significant procedure that alters joint anatomy and function. The detailed operative report should document the diagnostic workup (including imaging findings), the specific pathology or deformity necessitating condylar removal, the surgical approach (preauricular, submandibular, retromandibular, or combined), protection of vital structures (particularly the facial nerve), extent of condylar resection, management of the articular disc if present, any reconstructive procedures performed, method of securing the remaining mandibular segment, intraoperative assessment of occlusion, and the plan for post-operative physical therapy and rehabilitation. If the condylectomy is performed for pathology, documentation should reference submission of the specimen for pathological examination.

#### **Code: D7850** – *Surgical discectomy, with/without implant*
**Use when:** Surgically removing the intra-articular disc of the TMJ with or without replacement with an implant or autogenous/alloplastic material.
**Check:** Documentation should confirm removal of the articular disc, detail the surgical approach, describe the condition of the removed disc, and specify whether an implant was placed.
**Note:** Discectomy is typically performed for internal derangements that have not responded to conservative therapy. The comprehensive operative report should document previous treatments attempted, preoperative imaging findings, the specific surgical approach, protection of neurovascular structures, articular disc findings upon exposure (position, morphology, perforations, adhesions), technique for discectomy, management of attachments, inspection of articular surfaces, whether an implant or interpositional material was placed (including type and material), closure technique, immediate post-operative assessment, and the rehabilitation protocol. If no implant is placed, documentation should address the rationale for this decision and how joint function is expected to continue without disc replacement.

#### **Code: D7852** – *Disc repair*
**Use when:** Surgically repositioning and/or repairing a damaged intra-articular disc of the temporomandibular joint rather than removing it.
**Check:** Documentation should detail the specific disc abnormality being addressed, the surgical approach, repair technique, and method of ensuring the disc remains in the corrected position.
**Note:** Disc repair procedures include disc repositioning, plication, or reconstruction of a perforated or deformed disc. The detailed operative report should document the preoperative diagnosis (based on clinical and imaging findings), the specific surgical approach, joint space exposure technique, direct visualization findings of the disc and its attachments, the specific repair technique employed (suturing, plication, partial resection with repair), methods used to secure the disc in its new position (sutures to retrodiscal tissue, temporary anchoring), verification of proper disc-condyle relationship throughout range of motion, closure technique, and the post-operative management plan including physical therapy protocol. Documentation should address the expected prognosis based on intraoperative findings and specific repair technique.

#### **Code: D7854** – *Synovectomy*
**Use when:** Surgically removing diseased synovial membrane from the temporomandibular joint spaces to address inflammatory conditions, synovial chondromatosis, or other pathology of the synovium.
**Check:** Documentation should confirm the presence of diseased synovial tissue, detail the surgical approach and extent of synovectomy, and include the pathological diagnosis if available.
**Note:** Synovectomy targets the synovial lining of the joint capsule and may involve one or both joint compartments (superior and/or inferior). The comprehensive operative report should document the preoperative diagnosis and imaging findings, the specific surgical approach, protection of vital structures, joint space exposure technique, direct visualization findings of the synovial tissue, the extent and location of synovial removal, inspection of articular surfaces and disc, management of any concurrent pathology, irrigation of the joint space, closure technique, and specimen submission for pathological examination. Post-operative management should address inflammation control, physical therapy protocol, and monitoring for recurrence of synovial disease.

#### **Code: D7856** – *Myotomy*
**Use when:** Surgically cutting specific muscles of mastication for therapeutic purposes, typically to address trismus, muscle contracture, or as part of the management of TMJ disorders.
**Check:** Documentation should identify the specific muscle(s) being partially or completely transected, the surgical approach, and the clinical justification for muscle cutting.
**Note:** Myotomy procedures in TMJ disorders most commonly involve the lateral pterygoid, masseter, or temporalis muscles. The detailed procedure note should document previous conservative treatments attempted, preoperative assessment of mandibular function and restrictions, the specific surgical approach and exposure, identification and protection of neurovascular structures, the exact location and extent of muscle transection, intraoperative assessment of improvement in mandibular mobility, closure technique, and the post-operative physical therapy protocol. The documentation should address the expected functional outcome and potential adaptations in mandibular movement following alteration of the muscle mechanics. If performed in conjunction with other TMJ procedures, each component should be separately documented.

#### **Code: D7858** – *Joint reconstruction*
**Use when:** Performing extensive surgical reconstruction of the temporomandibular joint components, which may include reshaping osseous elements, disc repositioning or replacement, and addressing both hard and soft tissue components to restore joint anatomy and function.
**Check:** Documentation should detail the comprehensive nature of the reconstruction, including which specific components of the joint were addressed (osseous, articular surfaces, disc, attachments) and the techniques employed.
**Note:** TMJ reconstruction represents one of the most complex procedures in this category, often performed for end-stage joint pathology or significant anatomical deformities. The extensive operative report should document the preoperative diagnostic workup (including 3D imaging), previous treatments, the specific surgical approach, protection of vital structures, exposure of all joint components, detailed assessment of each component's pathology, the specific reconstructive techniques employed for each component (osseous recontouring, disc repair or replacement, cartilage grafting), any autogenous or alloplastic materials used, stabilization methods, verification of proper joint mechanics throughout range of motion, closure technique, and the comprehensive post-operative rehabilitation protocol. Documentation should address expected functional outcomes, potential limitations, and long-term monitoring plans.

#### **Code: D7860** – *Arthrotomy*
**Use when:** Creating a surgical incision into the temporomandibular joint space for purposes of direct visualization, removal of loose bodies, biopsy, or other therapeutic interventions that do not fall under more specific procedure codes.
**Check:** Documentation should detail the surgical approach, specify which joint space was entered (superior, inferior, or both), and describe the intra-articular findings and any procedures performed within the joint.
**Note:** Arthrotomy provides direct access to the joint spaces and is often the initial step in other more specific TMJ procedures. When coded independently, the procedure note should document the indication for joint access, the specific surgical approach (preauricular being most common), protection of the facial nerve and other vital structures, the specific joint compartment(s) entered, direct visualization findings, any diagnostic or therapeutic procedures performed within the joint space (biopsy, loose body removal, irrigation), closure technique, and post-operative management plan. If arthrotomy is performed as an approach for another defined procedure (such as discectomy or condylectomy), the more specific procedure code should be used instead.

#### **Code: D7865** – *Arthroplasty*
**Use when:** Surgically reshaping or recontouring the osseous components of the temporomandibular joint (mandibular condyle, glenoid fossa, or articular eminence) to improve joint function, eliminate bony interferences, or create a functional pseudarthrosis.
**Check:** Documentation should specify which bony structures were recontoured, the technique used for recontouring, and the functional goal of the procedure.
**Note:** Arthroplasty procedures modify the joint's bony architecture and may address condylar hypertrophy, irregular remodeling, osteophytes, or alterations of the articular eminence. The detailed operative report should document preoperative imaging findings, the specific surgical approach, protection of neurovascular structures, exposure of the targeted osseous components, direct visualization assessment, the specific recontouring technique (bur, saw, file, rongeur), the amount and location of bone removal, management of the articular disc if encountered, verification of improved joint mechanics through range of motion testing, irrigation and removal of bone debris, closure technique, and the post-operative physical therapy protocol. For procedures involving the articular eminence, documentation should specifically address changes to translation mechanics and how potential subluxation/dislocation issues will be managed.

#### **Code: D7870** – *Arthrocentesis*
**Use when:** Performing needle aspiration of fluid from the temporomandibular joint space, typically for diagnostic analysis or therapeutic relief of pressure.
**Check:** Documentation should confirm successful joint space access and fluid withdrawal, specify the amount and characteristics of any fluid obtained, and detail the approach used.
**Note:** While technically less complex than surgical procedures, arthrocentesis documentation requires specific elements. The procedure note should document the indication for joint aspiration (diagnostic or therapeutic), landmarks used for needle placement, confirmation of correct joint space entry, volume and characteristics of fluid aspirated, any analysis requested on the fluid specimen (culture, cell count, crystal analysis), immediate post-procedure assessment, and follow-up plans based on findings. If performed as a therapeutic lavage procedure with inflow and outflow (lysis and lavage), code D7871 would be more appropriate. For single-needle diagnostic aspirations, documentation should specify which joint compartment was sampled (usually the superior joint space).

#### **Code: D7871** – *Non-arthroscopic lysis and lavage*
**Use when:** Performing irrigation and lavage of the temporomandibular joint space using needles or cannulas (not an arthroscope) to break adhesions and remove inflammatory mediators.
**Check:** Documentation should detail the technique for joint access (single or double needle/cannula), confirm successful lavage with inflow and outflow, and specify the volume and type of irrigation solution used.
**Note:** This procedure aims to address early internal derangements, adhesions, or inflammatory conditions without direct surgical exposure. The detailed procedure note should document the preoperative diagnosis, landmarks for needle placement, confirmation of correct joint space entry (often with reference to fluid backflow or injection resistance), the specific technique (single needle with alternating injection/aspiration or double needle with continuous flow), total volume of lavage solution used, characteristics of outflow fluid, passive manipulation performed during lavage if applicable, post-lavage injectables administered (steroids, hyaluronic acid), immediate post-procedure assessment of mandibular mobility, and the follow-up management plan including physical therapy. This procedure is distinct from arthroscopy as it does not involve direct visualization of the joint space.

#### **Code: D7872** – *Arthroscopy - diagnosis, with or without biopsy*
**Use when:** Performing endoscopic examination of the temporomandibular joint using an arthroscope for diagnostic visualization, with or without biopsy of intra-articular tissues.
**Check:** Documentation should confirm successful arthroscopic entry and visualization, detail the specific findings observed, and document any biopsy specimens obtained.
**Note:** Diagnostic arthroscopy allows direct visualization of the joint spaces (typically the superior joint space) with minimal surgical trauma. The comprehensive procedure note should document the indication for arthroscopy, the specific portal approach, insertion technique, systematic examination of joint structures (disc, articular surfaces, synovium, attachments), photographic or video documentation if obtained, any abnormal findings, specific location and technique for any biopsies obtained, irrigation performed, portal closure, and immediate post-procedure assessment. This code applies when the procedure is performed solely for diagnostic purposes or with minimal interventions (biopsy only); more extensive therapeutic arthroscopic procedures should be coded with D7873-D7877 as appropriate.

#### **Code: D7873** – *Arthroscopy - lavage and lysis of adhesions*
**Use when:** Using an arthroscope to directly visualize the TMJ space while performing irrigation and breaking of adhesions between the disc, condyle, and fossa using hydraulic pressure, instruments, or both.
**Check:** Documentation should confirm arthroscopic visualization of adhesions, detail the specific techniques used for lysis (hydraulic, mechanical, or both), and document the volume of irrigation performed.
**Note:** This therapeutic arthroscopic procedure addresses adhesions that limit joint mobility. The detailed operative report should document preoperative imaging findings, portal placement technique, diagnostic survey of the joint space, specific locations and extent of adhesions identified, techniques employed for adhesion release (hydraulic pressure, blunt trocar, specialized instruments), direct visualization confirmation of adhesion lysis, range of motion assessment during the procedure, volume and type of irrigation solution used, any medications instilled into the joint space following lavage, portal closure technique, and the post-operative physical therapy protocol. Documentation should compare pre- and post-procedure mandibular mobility to demonstrate the effectiveness of adhesion release.

#### **Code: D7874** – *Arthroscopy - disc repositioning and stabilization*
**Use when:** Performing arthroscopically-guided manipulation, repositioning, and stabilization of the displaced articular disc using specialized instruments and techniques while directly visualizing the joint space.
**Check:** Documentation should confirm disc displacement or malposition visualized arthroscopically, detail the specific techniques used to reposition the disc, and describe any methods employed to stabilize the disc in its new position.
**Note:** This advanced arthroscopic procedure addresses internal derangements with disc displacement. The comprehensive operative report should document preoperative diagnosis and imaging findings, portal placement technique, diagnostic survey of the joint space, direct visualization assessment of disc position and morphology, specific techniques employed for disc manipulation (retraction instruments, suture placement), methods for disc stabilization (suturing, scarification, thermal modification), verification of improved disc-condyle relationship throughout range of motion, any concurrent procedures (adhesion lysis, lavage), medications instilled post-procedure, portal closure, and the structured post-operative protocol for maintaining the disc position. Post-operative management often includes temporary occlusal appliances and restricted function, which should be documented in the treatment plan.

#### **Code: D7875** – *Arthroscopy - synovectomy*
**Use when:** Using an arthroscope to visualize and guide the removal of inflamed or pathological synovial tissue from the temporomandibular joint space using specialized instruments.
**Check:** Documentation should confirm arthroscopic visualization of abnormal synovium, detail the extent and location of synovial removal, and document any specimens submitted for pathological examination.
**Note:** This procedure targets the synovial lining of the joint and is typically performed for inflammatory arthritis or synovial chondromatosis. The detailed operative report should document preoperative diagnosis and imaging findings, portal placement technique, diagnostic survey of the joint space, direct visualization assessment of the extent and character of synovial pathology, the specific instruments used for synovial removal (shavers, biters, ablation devices), systematic approach to ensure complete synovial debridement within the targeted compartment, evaluation of other joint structures, copious irrigation performed, any specimens submitted for pathologic examination, medications instilled post-procedure, portal closure, and the post-operative management plan including anti-inflammatory measures and physical therapy protocol.

#### **Code: D7876** – *Arthroscopy - discectomy*
**Use when:** Removing a damaged or deformed articular disc through arthroscopic visualization and specialized instruments, without open joint surgery.
**Check:** Documentation should confirm arthroscopic visualization of a pathological disc, detail the technique for intra-articular disc removal, and document the extent of discectomy (partial or complete).
**Note:** Arthroscopic discectomy is technically challenging due to the confined space and the need to remove the disc through small portals. The comprehensive operative report should document preoperative diagnosis and imaging findings, portal placement technique (usually requiring multiple portals), diagnostic survey of the joint space, direct visualization assessment of disc pathology justifying removal, the specific instruments and techniques for disc resection (piecemeal removal is common), sequential steps for ensuring complete targeted discectomy, management of disc attachments, evaluation of articular surfaces following disc removal, copious irrigation to remove debris, any therapeutic medications instilled, portal closure technique, and the detailed post-operative management plan. The documentation should address expected functional changes following disc removal and whether future reconstruction is anticipated.

#### **Code: D7877** – *Arthroscopy - debridement*
**Use when:** Using an arthroscope to guide the removal of pathologic hard and/or soft tissue from the temporomandibular joint space, including degenerative tissue, loose bodies, or osteophytes.
**Check:** Documentation should specify the pathological tissues identified and debrided arthroscopically, detail the debridement technique and instruments used, and document the extent of joint cleaning performed.
**Note:** This procedure encompasses a range of arthroscopic cleaning interventions not covered by more specific codes. The detailed operative report should document preoperative diagnosis and imaging findings, portal placement technique, diagnostic survey of the joint space, specific pathological findings requiring debridement (fibrillated cartilage, osteophytes, loose bodies, degenerative tissue), the instruments and techniques used for debridement (shavers, burrs, graspers), sequential approach to ensure thorough debridement of all pathologic tissue, post-debridement assessment of joint surfaces and function, copious irrigation to remove debris, any therapeutic medications instilled, portal closure technique, and the post-operative rehabilitation protocol. Documentation should clearly identify all types of tissue debrided (osseous, cartilaginous, fibrotic) and the functional improvement expected from the debridement.

#### **Code: D7880** – *Occlusal orthotic device, by report*
**Use when:** Fabricating and delivering a removable dental appliance designed to manage temporomandibular disorders by altering occlusal relationships, reducing muscle hyperactivity, or repositioning the mandible and/or articular disc.
**Check:** Documentation should specify the type of orthotic device provided (stabilization, anterior repositioning, etc.), detail the clinical indications for the appliance, and describe the fabrication and adjustment process.
**Note:** Though not a surgical procedure, occlusal orthotic therapy is an important TMD treatment. The comprehensive documentation should include the specific diagnosis and findings necessitating the appliance (joint sounds, limited opening, pain, disc displacement), the design and type of orthotic (material, coverage, thickness, occlusal philosophy), impression and registration techniques, laboratory prescription details, delivery procedure including adjustments for fit and occlusion, patient instructions for use and care, planned wear schedule (full-time, nights only, etc.), follow-up schedule for monitoring and adjustment, and expected therapeutic goals. The "by report" designation requires detailed documentation of the specific device design and therapeutic intent to justify medical necessity. Periodic assessment of treatment response should be documented during follow-up visits.

#### **Code: D7881** – *Occlusal orthotic device adjustment*
**Use when:** Performing modifications to a previously delivered occlusal orthotic device to address comfort, fit, occlusal relationships, or therapeutic effectiveness.
**Check:** Documentation should specify the reason for adjustment, detail the specific modifications made to the appliance, and document the post-adjustment assessment of fit and function.
**Note:** Adjustment visits are integral to successful orthotic therapy. The documentation should include the patient's report of appliance function since the previous visit, assessment of the appliance condition, specific areas requiring adjustment, the precise modifications performed (occlusal refinement, reduction of pressure areas, extension or reduction of borders, changes in condylar positioning elements), verification of comfort and proper seating post-adjustment, any changes to the wear schedule or usage instructions, and planned timing for re-evaluation. If significant changes to the therapeutic goal or design of the appliance are made, these should be specifically documented with rationale. This code should not be used for routine polishing or cleaning of the appliance.

#### **Code: D7899** – *Unspecified TMD therapy, by report*
**Use when:** Providing a temporomandibular disorder treatment or procedure that is not adequately described by another existing code in the TMJ section.
**Check:** Documentation must include a detailed description of the procedure performed, specific justification for why existing codes are insufficient, and comprehensive clinical information supporting medical necessity.
**Note:** This unspecified procedure code requires exceptionally detailed documentation. The comprehensive report should include the specific diagnosis and clinical findings, a complete description of the procedure performed including all technical elements, explanation of why this approach was selected over coded alternatives, all materials or devices utilized, the time involved in performing the procedure, the expected therapeutic benefit, post-procedure management protocol, and planned follow-up to assess outcomes. Whenever possible, comparison to similar coded procedures should be provided to clarify how this procedure differs. This code should only be used when a more specific code is truly unavailable, not for convenience or when documentation requirements of a specific code seem burdensome.

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Closed vs. Open Approaches** - Documentation should clearly distinguish between closed procedures (manipulation, arthrocentesis) and open surgical approaches, with detailed description of the specific approach used.
- **Disc Management** - For procedures involving the articular disc, documentation should address the pre-procedure disc position, condition, and post-procedure status or positioning.
- **Surgical Approach Documentation** - The specific surgical approach (preauricular, endaural, retromandibular) should be documented for all open TMJ procedures, including steps taken to protect the facial nerve.
- **Joint Space Specification** - Documentation should specify which joint compartment was entered or treated (superior, inferior, or both) for all invasive TMJ procedures.
- **Arthroscopic Portal Details** - For arthroscopic procedures, portal placement technique and location should be specifically documented.
- **Functional Assessment** - Pre- and post-procedure evaluation of mandibular range of motion and function should be included in the documentation.
- **Physical Therapy Integration** - Post-procedure physical therapy protocols should be detailed in the documentation for most TMJ procedures.
- **Orthotic Specificity** - For occlusal orthotic therapy, the specific design, materials, coverage, and therapeutic goal should be documented.
- **Imaging Correlation** - Reference to relevant preoperative imaging that guided treatment planning strengthens documentation for all TMJ procedures.
- **By Report Requirements** - For "by report" codes (D7880, D7899), exceptionally detailed documentation is required to justify medical necessity and clarify the nature of the procedure.
