# Dental Evaluation CDT Code Cheat Sheet

---

## 📘 CDT Code Reference

### **D0120 – Periodic Oral Evaluation (Established Patient)**
**When to Use:**
- Routine recall exams for established patients
- Typically every 6 months

**What to Check:**
- Patient must have had a prior D0120 or D0150
- Includes:
  - Medical/Dental history update
  - Oral cancer screening
  - Periodontal screening
  - Caries risk assessment

**Notes:**
- No treatment included under this code
- Additional diagnostics must be billed separately
- Findings must be discussed with the patient

---

### **D0140 – Limited Oral Evaluation (Problem Focused)**
**When to Use:**
- For emergency visits or specific dental issues:
  - Pain
  - Swelling
  - Broken teeth
  - Trauma

**What to Check:**
- Radiographs, testing, or treatment may be needed
- Separate CDT codes for each

**Notes:**
- Appropriate for new or established patients with urgent needs
- May lead to same-day treatment

---

### **D0145 – Oral Evaluation for Patient Under 3 Years + Caregiver Counseling**
**When to Use:**
- Children under 3 years
- Preferably within 6 months of first tooth eruption

**What to Check:**
- Includes:
  - Review of oral/physical health history
  - Cavity risk assessment
  - Prevention planning
  - Counseling parent/caregiver

**Notes:**
- Education is the primary purpose, not treatment

---

### **D0150 – Comprehensive Oral Evaluation (New or Established Patient)**
**When to Use:**
- New patients
- Established patients with major changes or returning after 3+ years

**What to Check:**
- Must include:
  - Complete dental/medical history
  - Oral cancer screening
  - Full perio charting
  - Occlusion/TMJ review

**Notes:**
- More in-depth than D0120
- No treatment included under this code

---

### **D0160 – Detailed and Extensive Oral Evaluation (Problem-Focused, By Report)**
**When to Use:**
- Complex cases needing:
  - Multidisciplinary input
  - Advanced diagnostics
  - TMJ or dentofacial anomaly management

**What to Check:**
- Full documentation required:
  - Condition description
  - Special diagnostics used

**Notes:**
- Requires a written report

---

### **D0170 – Re-Evaluation (Limited, Problem-Focused – Not Post-Op)**
**When to Use:**
- Follow-up for:
  - Soft tissue lesion
  - Pain recheck
  - Traumatic injury monitoring

**What to Check:**
- Patient must have had an earlier documented evaluation

**Notes:**
- Not for post-op check-ups
- Used to monitor specific known problems

---

### **D0171 – Re-Evaluation (Post-Operative Visit)**
**When to Use:**
- After surgeries like:
  - Extraction
  - Periodontal therapy
  - Implant placement

**What to Check:**
- Evaluation is for healing/complication review

**Notes:**
- Should reference the procedure performed

---

### **D0180 – Comprehensive Periodontal Evaluation (New or Established Patient)**
**When to Use:**
- Patient must come to the doctor because of signs of periodontal disease or have a history of periodontal disease (reason for visit), e.g.:
  - Bleeding gums
  - Diabetes
  - Smoking
  - Bone loss

**What to Check:**
- Must include:
  - 6-point periodontal probing
  - Full periodontal charting
  - Occlusion and tooth restoration check

**Notes:**
- More extensive than D0150
- Should not be used casually—only when periodontal concern is valid
