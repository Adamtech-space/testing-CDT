### **General Guidelines for Selecting Codes:**
1. **Determine the Test Purpose:** Identify whether the test is for microbial, genetic, caries risk, or systemic health assessment.
2. **Check Testing Methodology:** Ensure proper sample collection and analysis.
3. **Document Findings:** Properly record test results and their implications for treatment.
4. **Ensure Compliance:** Follow lab regulations and public health guidelines.
