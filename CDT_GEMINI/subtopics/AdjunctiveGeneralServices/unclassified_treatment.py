    ## **Unclassified Treatment** 
 
### **Before picking a code, ask:** 
- Does the procedure or service fit any existing CDT code? 
- Has the procedure been performed using a new or emerging technology? 
- Is the procedure or service experimental or investigational? 
- Is there documentation explaining why a standard code doesn't apply? 
- Is there a clinical narrative that describes the specific treatment in detail?

### **Detailed Coding Guidelines for Unclassified Treatment** 
 
#### **Code: D9999** â€“ *Unspecified Adjunctive Procedure, By Report* 
**Use when:** A dental procedure is performed that cannot be adequately described by any other existing CDT code. 
**Check:** Ensure that no standard code exists that could adequately describe the procedure. 
**Note:** This code requires a detailed narrative report that explains the nature, extent, and necessity of the procedure and the time, effort, and equipment required. 
 
---
 
### **Common Uses for D9999:** 
- New or evolving dental procedures not yet assigned a specific code 
- Experimental or innovative treatments 
- Use of technology or approaches that significantly modify standard procedures 
- Services that combine elements of multiple procedures in a way not described by existing codes 
 
---
 
### **Key Takeaways:** 
- **D9999 should be a last resort** when no other code accurately describes the procedure. 
- **Always include a detailed report** with clinical documentation and justification. 
- **Check for updates to CDT codes** before using D9999, as new codes are added regularly. 
- **The narrative should explain why** standard codes are insufficient. 
 
This code is subject to greater scrutiny by payers and may require additional documentation for reimbursement.
