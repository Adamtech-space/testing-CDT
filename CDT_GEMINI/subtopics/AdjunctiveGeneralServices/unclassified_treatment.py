## **Unclassified Treatment**

### **Before picking a code, ask:**
- Does the procedure or service fit any existing CDT code?
- Has the procedure been performed using a new or emerging technology?
- Is the procedure or service experimental or investigational?
- Is there documentation explaining why a standard code doesn't apply?
- Is there a clinical narrative that describes the specific treatment in detail?

---

### **Detailed Coding Guidelines for Unclassified Treatment**

#### **Code: D9999** â€“ *Unspecified Adjunctive Procedure, By Report*
**Use when:** A dental procedure is performed that cannot be adequately described by any other existing CDT code.
**Check:** Ensure that no standard code exists that could adequately describe the procedure.
**Note:** This code requires a detailed narrative report that explains the nature, extent, and necessity of the procedure and the time, effort, and equipment required.

---

### **Common Uses for D9999:**
- New or evolving dental procedures not yet assigned a specific code
- Experimental or innovative treatments
- Use of technology or approaches that significantly modify standard procedures
- Services that combine elements of multiple procedures in a way not described by existing codes

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **D9999 should be a last resort** when no other code accurately describes the procedure.
- **Always include a detailed report** with clinical documentation and justification.
- **Check for updates to CDT codes** before using D9999, as new codes are added regularly.
- **The narrative should explain why** standard codes are insufficient.

This code is subject to greater scrutiny by payers and may require additional documentation for reimbursement.
