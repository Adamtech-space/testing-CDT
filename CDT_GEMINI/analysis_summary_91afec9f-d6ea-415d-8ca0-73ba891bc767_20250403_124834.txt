USER QUESTION:
A new patient, age 11, was seen for a first exam, cleaning, and fluoride varnish application. During the exam, the dentist noted that the erupting tooth #4 was impinging on the fixed space maintainer that spanned both the right and left side of the mouth. This space maintainer had been placed by another dentist but it was decided that the space maintainer needed to be removed now.

PROCESSED SCENARIO:
cleaned data: A new patient, age 11, was seen for a first exam, which included a cleaning and fluoride varnish application. During the examination, the dentist observed that the erupting tooth #4 was impinging on a fixed space maintainer that spanned both the right and left sides of the mouth. This space maintainer had been placed by another dentist. It was determined that the space maintainer needed to be removed at this time. The visit type is classified as a first visit, and the patient is identified as a new patient. The treatment details include the cleaning, fluoride varnish application, and the decision to remove the space maintainer due to the impingement caused by the erupting tooth #4. These elements are relevant for CDT coding, particularly the cleaning, fluoride application, and the removal of the space maintainer.

Additional information provided:
Q: - Can you confirm whether the space maintainer is located in the maxillary or mandibular arch?
A: no
Q: - Can you provide more details on the specific developmental disorder affecting tooth #4, such as whether it involves malocclusion or another condition?
A: no


CDT ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
CDT Code Ranges: D0100-D0999,D1000-D1999,D5000-D5899,D9000-D9999

ACTIVATED TOPICS AND SUBTOPICS:
- Diagnostic (D0100-D0999):
  - Clinical Oral Evaluations (D0120-D0180)
  - Pre-diagnostic Services (D0190-D0191)
  - Diagnostic Imaging (D0210-D0391)
- Preventive (D1000-D1999):
  - Dental Prophylaxis (D1110-D1120)
  - Topical Fluoride Treatment (D1206-D1208)
  - Other Preventive Services (D1310-D1355)
  - Space Maintainers (D1510-D1575)
- Prosthodontics Removable (D5000-D5899):
- Adjunctive General Services (D9000-D9999):
  - Unclassified Treatment (D9110-D9130)
  - Miscellaneous Services (D9910-D9973)

VALIDATED CDT CODES:
- D0150
- D1120
- D1206
- D1557

Explanation:  - D0150 (comprehensive oral evaluation - new or established patient) is selected because the scenario describes a first exam for a new patient, which aligns with a comprehensive oral evaluation. The evaluation included assessing the impingement of the erupting tooth on the space maintainer, which is part of the comprehensive assessment of the oral condition. - D1120 (prophylaxis - child) is appropriate as the patient is 11 years old, and the scenario describes a cleaning procedure, which qualifies for the child prophylaxis code. - D1206 (topical application of fluoride varnish) is included because the scenario explicitly mentions the application of fluoride varnish to all teeth surfaces for the patient. - D1557 (removal of fixed bilateral space maintainer - maxillary) is selected for the removal of the fixed bilateral space maintainer. Although the scenario does not specify whether the space maintainer is in the maxillary or mandibular arch, D1557 is chosen based on the description of the procedure. The doubts regarding the arch location do not affect the applicability of this code for the removal of a bilateral space maintainer. Codes such as D9910 were not selected because they pertain to desensitizing medicaments, which are not explicitly mentioned in the scenario. Additionally, no diagnostic imaging codes were included as there was no explicit mention of imaging being performed.

ICD ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
- Category: 8. Developmental Disorders of Teeth and Jaws (K00.x, K07.x series: anodontia, malocclusion)
  Codes: 
  Explanation: 

VALIDATED ICD CODES:
- Z01.21
- K00.6

Explanation: Z01.21 (Encounter for dental examination and cleaning with abnormal findings) is appropriate because the scenario describes a new patient visit for a dental examination and cleaning, during which an abnormal finding (the impingement of the erupting tooth #4 on the space maintainer) was observed. This code is used to document the encounter for a dental examination when there are abnormal findings. K00.6 (Disturbances in tooth eruption) is selected because the scenario involves an erupting tooth (#4) that is causing impingement on a space maintainer. This code is used to document issues related to the eruption of teeth, which is relevant given the description of the erupting tooth causing a problem. Other potential codes related to developmental disorders of teeth and jaws were not selected because there is no specific mention of malocclusion or other developmental disorders affecting tooth #4 in the scenario. Additionally, without specific information on the location of the space maintainer (maxillary or mandibular arch), codes that require such details were not considered. The focus is on the documented abnormal finding and the disturbance in tooth eruption.
